In React, the createRoot method creates a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM stored in memory. When the UI updates, React creates a new Virtual DOM, compares it with the old one to find changes (this process is called Reconciliation), and then updates only the changed parts in the Real DOM. This makes the app faster and avoids full page reloads. React uses Fiber, an advanced version of the reconciliation algorithm, to pause, prioritize, or reuse work for better performance.
