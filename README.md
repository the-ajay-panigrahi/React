# React Playground

This is my playground for learning. 
I'll be throwing code snippets in here and tinkering with all sorts of concepts as I go.

Just remember (but don't take this too seriouslyðŸ˜‰):
> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

Feel free to explore and use anything you find helpful.

Happy coding!
